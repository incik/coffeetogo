# CoffeeToGo
This is a simple structure/toolchain that enables you to quickly start development your own CoffeeScript applications. Configuring Grunt can be painful, that's why here everything is set in a way that you can just download repository (or fork it if you want to get any future updates) and start to develop your awesomeness.

### Installation
You need Grunt and all its dependencies. You can find installation guide on http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt.

CoffeeToGo's dependencies can be installed with command

```sh
$ npm install
```

For testing you will also need [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs).

## Usage
By default source codes and test are placed in **src** and **test** directory respectively.

Default grunt task, which will be executed by running
```sh
$ grunt
```
does following:
 - compiles sources (into *tmp/src* directory)
 - compiles tests (into *tmp/test* directory)
 - runs unit tests
 - if all tests do pass, compiled sources are copied into **dist** directory.

If you don't want to manually run compilation everytime you make change in a file, you can easily run *daemon* in background with
```sh
$ grunt watch
```
and watch how all your tests are being executed and new versions of your scripts are being generated by themself ;-)

### Additional functionality
 - **grunt clean** - deletes all stuff, that has been generated (i.e. if you want commit just sources)

## Changelog
### 0.1
First public version.
 - Automatic compilation to JavaScript with
 - Unit tests via Karma & Jasmine
